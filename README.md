# Health Management
> Say Hello to Jarvis, your Personal health manager

I did this as a Mini-Project in C++ during the first year of my college. A normal application which takes input from the console, but I have added the audio files to play in the background as a part of interacting with the users.
### How to run?
- Download all these files
- Add winmm to your complier linker settings
- Compile and execute the code NEW.cpp
